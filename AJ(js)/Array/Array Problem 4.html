    <h1>Array Problem 4
        Write a program to find out the difference between sum of all the elements in two arrays arr1 and arr2.
        If sum of all elements in arr1 is larger then, the output should be First array is larger,
        if sum of all elements in arr2 is larger then, the output should be Second array is larger,
        otherwise the output should be Both are equal.
        
        Input Format
        First line contains n, size of the first array.
        
        Second line contains n elements of the first array.
        
        Third line contains m, size of the second array.
        
        Fourth line contains m elements of the second array.
        
        n and m will always be equal.
        
        Output Format
        Print the output as per difference.
        
        Example 1
        Input
        
        2
        1 2
        2
        3 4
        Output
        
        Second array is larger
        Explanation
        
        Overall sum of first array is 1+2 = 3
        Overall sum of second array is 3+4 = 7
        Thus, second array is larger
        
        Example 2
        Input
        
        3
        1 2 10
        3
        3 4 1
        Output
        
        First array is larger
        Explanation
        
        Overall sum of first array is 1+2+10 = 13
        Overall sum of second array is 3+4+1 = 8
        Thus, first array is larger
        
        Example 3
        Input
        
        2
        1 3
        2
        2 2
        Output
        
        Both are equal
        Explanation
        
        The overall sum of the first array is 1+3 = 4
        The overall sum of the second array is 2+2 = 4
        Thus, both are equal</h1>
