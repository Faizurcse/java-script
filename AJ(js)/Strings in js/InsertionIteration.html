      Insertion Sort 2 In Insertion Sort Part 1, you inserted one element into
      an array at its correct sorted position. Using the same approach
      repeatedly, can you sort an entire array? Guideline: You already can place
      an element into a sorted array. How can you use that code to build up a
      sorted array, one element at a time? Note that in the first step, when you
      consider an array with just the first element, it is already sorted since
      there is nothing to compare it to. In this challenge, print the array
      after each iteration of the insertion sort, i.e., whenever the next
      element has been inserted at its correct position. Since the array
      composed of just the first element is already sorted, begin printing after
      placing the second element. Input Format The first line contains an
      integer n,the size of the arr. The next line contains n spaced integers
      arr[i]. Output Format Print the entire array on a new line at every
      iteration. Example Input 6 1 4 3 5 6 2 Output 1 4 3 5 6 2 1 3 4 5 6 2 1 3
      4 5 6 2 1 3 4 5 6 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 Explanation Skip testing 1 against itself
      at position 0. It is sorted. Test position 1 against position 0:4>1, no
      more to check, no change. Print arr Test position 2 against positions 1
      and 0: 3<4 new position may be 1.Keep checking. 3>1 so insert 3 at
      position 1 and move others to the right. Print arr Test position 3 against
      positions 2,1,0 (as necessary): no change. Print arr Test position 4
      against positions 3,2,1,0: no change. Print arr Test position 4 against
      positions 4,3,2,1,0, insert 2 at position 1 and move others to the right.

      Example
        Input
        
        6
        1 4 3 5 6 2
        Output
        
        1 4 3 5 6 2
        1 3 4 5 6 2
        1 3 4 5 6 2
        1 3 4 5 6 2
